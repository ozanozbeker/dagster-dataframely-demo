"""Group `base`: the four tables every other group reads from.

Plain `@dg.asset`s with no schema attached, which is the point twice over. They are the control for `catalog`, where the same rows under a schema fill a Columns tab these cannot. And they are where the demo's data enters the graph, so every other asset has a parent and each group reads as one chain rather than a scatter of roots.

One asset per frame shape in `_data.py`. The failure groups need their defect to arrive from upstream rather than be manufactured in the asset that demonstrates it: a table whose dtype drifted is something that happens to you, and an asset that casts its own column to break its own schema is not the case worth showing.
