"""Group `partitions`: one dimension, two dimensions, and a fan-in over all of them.

`partitions_def` forwards to the underlying `multi_asset` verbatim, so partitioning needed no code in the package and has no setting of its own. Both outs carry it, which is what stops a quarantine escaping its asset's partitioning.

Validation runs per partition on that partition's frame, so `dagster/row_count` is that partition's count and a partition whose frame drifts aborts without touching any other partition's file.
